# ChromeDriver Lifecycle Management Implementation

## Overview
This implementation changes the ChromeDriver lifecycle in the RPA service to initialize on application boot and remain available throughout the application's lifecycle, with automatic recovery capabilities.

## Changes Made

### 1. ChromeDriverManager Service (`IChromeDriverManager` / `ChromeDriverManager`)
- **Purpose**: Singleton service that manages the ChromeDriver instance lifecycle
- **Key Features**:
  - Thread-safe singleton pattern using `SemaphoreSlim`
  - Automatic driver health checks
  - Recovery mechanism to recreate driver if it becomes unresponsive
  - Executes crawler after initialization
  - No headless mode - browser remains visible

### 2. ChromeDriverInitializationService (Background Service)
- **Purpose**: Initializes ChromeDriver on application boot
- **Behavior**: 
  - Runs once at application startup (after 2-second delay)
  - Calls `ChromeDriverManager.InitializeDriverAsync()`
  - Logs initialization status

### 3. Updated RpaProcessingService
- **Changes**:
  - Removed per-request driver creation
  - Now uses shared ChromeDriver instance via `IChromeDriverManager`
  - Calls `EnsureDriverAsync()` to get driver (auto-recovery if needed)
  - Browser remains open between requests (no `driver.Quit()`)
  - Driver is NOT disposed after processing

### 4. Updated Program.cs
- **Registration**:
  - `IChromeDriverManager` registered as Singleton
  - `ChromeDriverInitializationService` added as hosted service

## Key Requirements Met

✅ **ChromeDriver initialized on boot**: Background service initializes driver when application starts

✅ **Available throughout lifecycle**: Singleton pattern keeps driver alive for entire application lifetime

✅ **Reused for each request**: All RPA requests use the same shared driver instance

✅ **No headless mode**: `--headless` argument removed from ChromeOptions

✅ **Automatic recovery**: `EnsureDriverAsync()` checks driver health and recreates if unavailable

✅ **Crawler executes after initialization**: `ExecuteCrawlerAsync()` called after driver creation

## Technical Details

### ChromeOptions Configuration
```csharp
var options = new ChromeOptions();
options.AddArgument("--no-sandbox");
options.AddArgument("--disable-dev-shm-usage");
options.AddArgument("--disable-gpu");
options.AddArgument("--window-size=1920,1080");
options.AddArgument("--start-maximized");
// NOTE: --headless is NOT included
```

### Driver Recovery Logic
The `EnsureDriverAsync()` method:
1. Checks if driver exists
2. Tests driver responsiveness by accessing `CurrentWindowHandle`
3. If driver is unresponsive, disposes and reinitializes
4. Returns healthy driver instance

### Thread Safety
- Uses `SemaphoreSlim` to ensure thread-safe access to driver
- Prevents race conditions during initialization/disposal

## Benefits

1. **Performance**: No driver creation overhead for each request
2. **Resource Efficiency**: Single browser instance instead of multiple
3. **Session Persistence**: Browser state maintained between requests
4. **Reliability**: Automatic recovery if driver fails
5. **Observability**: Browser visible for debugging and monitoring

## Testing Recommendations

1. Verify driver initializes on application startup
2. Test multiple concurrent RPA requests use same driver
3. Verify driver recovery when browser is manually closed
4. Confirm browser window remains open between requests
5. Test crawler execution after initialization

## Security Summary

✅ No security vulnerabilities detected by CodeQL analysis
