# Fix Summary - HttpClient Disposal Error in RpaProcessingService

## Issue
The `RpaProcessingService` class was experiencing a `System.ObjectDisposedException` error with the message: "Cannot access a disposed object. Object name: 'System.Net.Http.HttpClient'." This error occurred when executing the line:
```csharp
var response = await _httpClient.PostAsync(url, content);
```
in the `SendResultToOrchestratorAsync` method.

## Root Cause
The problem had two root causes:

1. **Duplicate Service Registration**: The service was registered twice in `Program.cs`:
   - Once with `AddHttpClient<IRpaProcessingService, RpaProcessingService>()` 
   - And again with `AddScoped<IRpaProcessingService, RpaProcessingService>()`
   
   This created a conflict where the DI container could potentially use the scoped registration without the HttpClient dependency.

2. **Improper HttpClient Lifecycle Management**: The service was storing a direct `HttpClient` instance as a field, which could be disposed by the DI container before async operations completed, especially in long-running processes.

## Solution Implemented

### Changes Made

#### 1. RpaProcessingService.cs
**File**: `Robot.ED.FacebookConnector.Service.RPA/Services/RpaProcessingService.cs`

- **Constructor**: Changed from injecting `HttpClient` to injecting `IHttpClientFactory`
- **Field**: Changed `_httpClient` to `_httpClientFactory`
- **SendResultToOrchestratorAsync Method**: Modified to create HttpClient instances on-demand using the factory pattern with proper disposal via `using` statement

#### 2. Program.cs
**File**: `Robot.ED.FacebookConnector.Service.RPA/Program.cs`

- Removed the typed HttpClient registration `AddHttpClient<IRpaProcessingService, RpaProcessingService>()`
- Changed to generic `AddHttpClient()` to register the factory
- Kept the scoped service registration `AddScoped<IRpaProcessingService, RpaProcessingService>()`

### Key Code Changes

**Before:**
```csharp
// Constructor
private readonly HttpClient _httpClient;
public RpaProcessingService(HttpClient httpClient, ...)
{
    _httpClient = httpClient;
}

// Usage
_httpClient.DefaultRequestHeaders.Clear();
_httpClient.DefaultRequestHeaders.Add("Authorization", ...);
var response = await _httpClient.PostAsync(url, content);
```

**After:**
```csharp
// Constructor
private readonly IHttpClientFactory _httpClientFactory;
public RpaProcessingService(IHttpClientFactory httpClientFactory, ...)
{
    _httpClientFactory = httpClientFactory;
}

// Usage
using var httpClient = _httpClientFactory.CreateClient();
httpClient.DefaultRequestHeaders.Add("Authorization", ...);
var response = await httpClient.PostAsync(url, content);
```

## Benefits

1. ✅ **Eliminates ObjectDisposedException**: HttpClient is properly managed by the factory
2. ✅ **Thread-Safe**: Each request gets its own HttpClient instance
3. ✅ **Connection Pooling**: Factory reuses underlying connections efficiently
4. ✅ **Proper Resource Management**: `using` statement ensures disposal
5. ✅ **DNS Handling**: Factory handles DNS changes correctly
6. ✅ **Microsoft Best Practice**: Follows official .NET guidelines for HttpClient usage

## Verification

- ✅ Solution builds successfully with no errors
- ✅ Pre-existing warnings remain unchanged (unrelated to this fix)
- ✅ Changes are minimal and surgical
- ✅ Pattern matches the successful fix applied to RpaAllocationService

## Files Modified

1. `Robot.ED.FacebookConnector.Service.RPA/Services/RpaProcessingService.cs` - Updated to use IHttpClientFactory
2. `Robot.ED.FacebookConnector.Service.RPA/Program.cs` - Fixed duplicate service registration
